\maketitle

On the next pages, you will watch videos about derivatives and will then answer some questions about the video.

The key ideas of these videos are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The goal of this video is to understand how a GPS unit can find the speed of a car 10 seconds after it leaves an intersection.
\item You can approximate the speed at 10 seconds by finding an average speed over an interval immediately before or after the 10-second mark.
\item Average speed is found by dividing change in distance by change in time
\item For fixed amounts of change in time	t, the changes in the car’s distance will be increasing. Consequently, using the interval before the 10-second mark produces an underestimate of the car’s speed.
\end{itemize}
