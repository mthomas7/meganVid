\maketitle

On the next pages, you will watch videos about using basic derivative rules and will then answer some questions about the video.

Here are four questions that you should be able to answer after watching the video:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Why is the derivative of a constant function zero?
\item How do you find the derivative of a polynomial?
\item How do you find the derivative of an exponential function?
\item How do you find the derivative of a logarithmic function?
\end{enumerate}
